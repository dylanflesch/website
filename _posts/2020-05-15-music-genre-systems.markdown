#### Genre system classification  
Is it a list, thesaurus, taxonomy or ontology? Is it an Aristotelian or Prototype Classification? What is the intended use of this system? Does it attempt to be exhaustive or is it intended to only cover a specific use case or domain? What is it's primary organizing principle (geographic, audience-based, etc).  
#### Reverse engineering the system rules  
What are the rules of this system?  
Can a term have multiple parent terms? What are the parent terms for House and Techno for instance? Dance, Electronic and Popular? 
Are terms meant to be mostly distinct from one another? Or is overlap an encouraged/accepted part of the system?  
Are certain types of genre term excluded?  
-Location/Place based (think of both regions, countries, cities, but also place types like desert, swamp, urban or pub rock, juke joint blues  
-Time based (dates, seasons, or point in genre life cycle (i.e. proto, early, classic, revival, modern, neo)   
-Electronic/Acoustic variants  
-Instrumental variants  (piano blues, harmonica blues)  
-Artist form variations (crooner...)  
-Music form variations (12 bar blues)  
-Fusion genres  
-Demographic/Identity-based terms  
-Attitude/Scene-Norm/Purpose-based modifiers like "indie", "alternative", "protest"  
-Adjective modifiers like "heavy", "psychedelic", "deep"  
-Origin of term (systems often exclude terms seen as stricly from the label, marketing terms, or terms seen as primarily functioning as a radio format description more so than a genre per se)  
-Currency (does the system only include terms that are in active use today?)  
#### Strictly Genre terms vs. Genre Groupings interspersed within list of Genre terms? 
Think of genre groupings like "Roots Music", it's got overlap with marketing terms, but more than anything functions as a tool for inscribing a subset of artists from a subset of genres with additional cultural capital... Or "Electronic", it's too broad to really function as a meaningful genre term, so it's presence in these systems is usually just a way to group actual genres like house, techno, drum & bass, trance (and often to put them in lineage with music concrete, minimalism, etc...)    
#### Notable exclusions or inclusions
...  
#### Art-Folk-Popular
How does this genre system uphold or eschew the art-folk-popular trichotomy? Look at examples that help extrapolate the approach of the designers of this system. Does the system recognizes Art/Folk as broader terms for a music genre/form only if that distinction is observed in the locale that the music originates from? Or is that hierarchy imposed regardless of local norms?   
#### Popular vs. Pop  
Does the system differentiate between popular music and pop music?  
#### Blending of Rock/Pop  
Some systems blur the line between rock and pop, where in effect these two end up forming an "unnamed middle" that everything else is defined in relation to, does this system do that?  
#### Who is centered in this genre system?  
Look for "world music", or an equivalent term that functions as an "othering" of non-western musics?  
#### Handling of my personal focus genres  
Look in depth at my U.S.-popular-music-centric focus genres, how many sub terms exist under each of these? What parent terms are each of these arranged beneath?  
Spirituals  
Gospel  
Ragtime  
Blues  
Jazz  
Country  
Rhythm & Blues  
Rock 'n' Roll  
Soul  
Rock  
Funk  
Disco  
Rap and Hip Hop  
Electronic  
-House  
-Techno
