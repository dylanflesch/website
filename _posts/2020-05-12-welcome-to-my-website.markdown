I'm Dylan Flesch and I'm passionate about providing access to history through the preservation of recorded sounds and moving images. Libraries, archives, music and radio are my focus.

I've been meaning to create a "professional" website for a while now, and just recently found a simple way to do it. Thanks to [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org) for the easy step by step guide: [Building a static website with Jekyll and Github Pages](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages). 

I'll post projects, highlight inspiring work from others, and maybe write some stuff down here and there.
